    "\n",
    "In this machine learning endeavor, our primary objective is to empower taxi cab drivers by developing a predictive model that identifies and predicts generous tipping behavior among passengers. The ultimate goal is to enhance the revenue generated by taxi drivers, particularly through increased earnings from tips. To achieve this, we aim to construct a model capable of discerning customers who exhibit an exceptionally generous tipping inclination—specifically those who tip 20% or more of the fare amount. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we anticipate uncovering patterns and factors that contribute to a passenger's generosity, providing valuable insights to drivers and taxi service providers. This model not only supports individual drivers in customizing their service but also contributes to the broader optimization of the taxi service industry by fostering a more rewarding experience for both drivers and passengers."

    "**Ethical Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In lieu of tip estimation, the focus shifts to identifying generous customers for ethical considerations. Predicting tips poses potential challenges, as drivers may be disheartened if the app incorrectly informs them about a customer's intent to tip. This could erode trust in the application, impacting the overall relationship between drivers and the service. Moreover, if drivers begin avoiding passengers predicted not to tip, it may lead to accessibility issues for customers, especially those who cannot afford additional tips. The model's predictions could inadvertently influence driver behavior, affecting the equitable provision of taxi services. Choosing to identify generous customers mitigates these potential issues, aligning with ethical considerations to ensure fair and unbiased service delivery."

    "For a detailed understanding of each attribute and its significance, please refer to the [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/sssunri/farecast_NYC-TLC_estimation/blob/main/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) presented by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. The richness of this data dictionary is instrumental in comprehending the dataset, a crucial aspect in constructing a reliable fare estimation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate accurate prediction, the model requires historical behavioral data for each customer, including tipping patterns from previous taxi rides. Essential features encompass timestamps, dates, locations of pickups and dropoffs, estimated fares, and payment methods. The binary target variable signifies whether the customer is anticipated to tip ≥ 20%."

The dataset, containing 22,699 rows representing different trips and 18 columns, was provided by the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program for the purpose of the end-of-course portfolio project. Invaluable insights into the dataset's attributes and their meanings were derived from the detailed [Data Dictionary](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/biws-g3hs/files/eb3ccc47-317f-4b2a-8f49-5a684b0b1ecc?download=true&filename=data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) provided by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. We acknowledge the contribution of both the NYC TLC and the Google program to the dataset used in this analysis."
