    "**Executive Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm, is collaborating with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). Since its establishment in 1971, the TLC has been responsible for regulating and overseeing the licensing of various transportation services in New York City, including taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles <sup>[1]</sup>. The TLC envisions the development of a user-friendly app, and in partnership with Automatidata, aims to enhance the overall experience for TLC riders by providing the ability to estimate taxi fares in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initiative aligns seamlessly with Automatidata's mission to transform untapped and stored data into practical solutions. Leveraging the extensive NYC TLC dataset, our goal is to craft a robust regression model that accurately estimates taxi fares, offering transparency and convenience to riders. The FareCast NYC app aspires to not only address the business needs of the TLC but also strategically impact the transportation landscape by improving transparency in fare calculations.\n",

    "This project is inspired by the [Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics) program, specifically the end-of-course portfolio project titled *Automatidata*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilises a subset of the [2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs) obtained from the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, originally published as part of the NYC Open Data program. The dataset, containing 22,699 rows representing different trips and 18 columns, was provided by the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate program for the purpose of the end-of-course portfolio project. Invaluable insights into the dataset's attributes and their meanings were derived from the detailed [Data Dictionary](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/biws-g3hs/files/eb3ccc47-317f-4b2a-8f49-5a684b0b1ecc?download=true&filename=data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) provided by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. We acknowledge the contribution of both the NYC TLC and the Google program to the dataset used in this analysis."
